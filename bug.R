```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame based on a condition,
# but it produces an unexpected error because of how R handles logical indexing.

df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = letters[1:5])

# Incorrect subsetting:
result <- df[df$a > 2 & df$b == "c", ]
print(result)

# The expected output would be a data frame containing only the row where a > 2 and b == "c".
# However, due to operator precedence and how logical indexing works in R,
# this code might return an unexpected result or an error.
