```r
# This corrected code uses parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations,
# ensuring the logical condition is evaluated correctly before subsetting the data frame.

df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = letters[1:5])

# Correct subsetting:
result <- df[(df$a > 2) & (df$b == "c"), ]
print(result)

# This version will produce the expected output, correctly subsetting the data frame
# based on the combined logical condition.
